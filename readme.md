## Introduction

In this lab assignment, you will be developing your own debugger,
`snuDbg`. `snuDbg` is a simple Linux-based debugger, which relies on
`ptrace` syscalls. In the following, we will first describe how the
`ptrace` syscalls work, and how you will complete the assignment using
the `ptrace` syscalls.

## `ptrace` syscall

The ptrace() system call provides a means by which one process (the
"tracer") may observe and control the execution of another process
(the "tracee"), and examine and change the tracee's memory and
registers.  It is primarily used to implement breakpoint debugging and
system call tracing.


```
long ptrace(enum __ptrace_request request, pid_t pid, void *addr, void *data);
```

The `ptrace` syscall takes four arguments: `request` specifies the
action to be performed; `pid` denotes the target ID (i.e., thread or
process ID) to perform the action; `addr` and `data` provide the extra
parameter values for a certain `request`.

While this assignment would be sufficient to understand the following
`request` values, you are strongly encouraged to read through the man
page of `ptrace` to get more information.

- `PTRACE_TRACEME`: Indicate that this process is to be traced by its parent.
- `PTRACE_PEEKTEXT, PTRACE_PEEKDATA`: Read a word at the address `addr`
  in the tracee's memory, returning the word as the result of the
  ptrace() call.
- `PTRACE_POKETEXT, PTRACE_POKEDATA`: Copy the word `data` to the
  address `addr` in the tracee's memory.
- `PTRACE_GETREGS`: Copy the tracee's general-purpose or
  floating-point registers, respectively, to the address `data` in the
  tracer.
- `PTRACE_SETREGS`: Modify the tracee's general-purpose or
  floating-point registers, respectively, from the address `data` in the
  tracer.
- `PTRACE_SINGLESTEP`: Restart the stopped tracee as for PTRACE_CONT,
  but arrange for the tracee to be stopped at the next entry to or
  exit from a system call, or after execution of a single instruction,
  respectively.
- `PTRACE_CONT`: Restart the stopped tracee process.

Let's take a look at the simple code example of `ptrace`, which shows
the tracee runs `/bin/ls` and the tracer captures the current register
values of the tracee (the example is taken from
https://gist.github.com/willb/14488/80deaf4363ed408a562c53ab0e56d8833a34a8aa).

```c
pid_t child = fork();
if (child == 0) {
  ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME, 0, NULL, NULL);
  execl("/bin/ls", "ls", NULL);
} else {
  int status;

  while(waitpid(child, &status, 0) && ! WIFEXITED(status)) {
    struct user_regs_struct regs;
    ptrace(PTRACE_GETREGS, child, NULL, &regs);
  }
}
```

In this example, `fork()` creates two execution contexts, where the
parent process becomes the tracer and the child process becomes the
tracee.

In the case of the child process, it invokes `ptrace()` with
`PTRACE_TRACEME`, notifying the kernel that it would allow to be
traced by other processes. Then the child goes on invoking the syscall
`execl()` so that it replaces itself with the process executing
`/bin/ls`.

In the case of the parent process, it first waits until the child is
ready. Once ready, it invokes `ptrace()` with `PTRACE_GETREGS`, which
obtains the all register values of the child process.


## snuDbg

`snuDbg` is a simple Linux-based debugger. It takes the target program
through the terminal parameter (i.e., `USAGE: ./snudbg <cmd>`), and
provides various features to debug the target program.

In order to build `snuDbg`, run the command `make` in the `src`
directory, which generates the executable file, `snudbg`.

```sh
$ cd src
$ make
gcc -g -o snudbg snudbg.c procmaps.c -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wshadow -pedantic
$ ls -l snudbg
-rwxr-xr-x   1 blee           blee        40336 2022-10-06 14:31 snudbg
```

The following shows the running example, which debugs the program
`rand` (the source code of `rand` is given in
`test/sample-rand/rand.c`). Note that this shows the running result of
the reference implementation, which completed all the tasks.

```sh
$ ./snudbg ../test/prebuilt/rand

[*] Tracer with pid=15549
[*] Tracee with pid=15550

>>> continue
[*] HANDLE CMD: continue
Wrong answer. Your rand_value was 1acfafb6
[*] Exited in 4 steps with status=0
```

Once running, `snuDbg` shows the user prompt `>>>`, which waits for
the command from the user. `snuDbg` supports various commands, which
can be listed using the command `help`:

- **regs**: Shows values of all registers.
- **get [REG]**: Show the value of the register `REG`.
- **set [REG] [value]**: Set the value of the register `REG` with `value`.
- **read [addr] [size]**: Show the memory data values at the address `addr` with the size `size`.
- **write [addr] [value] [size]**: Set the memory data values at the address `addr` using the data `value` and the size `size`.
- **step**: Execute a single instruction.
- **continue**: Continue executing a program (until it reaches a breakpoint).
- **break [addr]**: Install the breakpoint at the address `addr`.


## Task: Complete the implementation of snuDbg

Your task is to complete the implementation of `snuDbg`. All your code
changes should be done in `snudbg.c`, and you should not modify any
other files. 

In order to correctly grade your implementation, you should strictly
follow all the instructions in `snudbg.c`. You should need to
implement the function with the annotation `TODO`, where you will need
to drop `TODO_UNUSED()` macros (this is used to avoid compilation
errors). If the function has the annotation `INSTRUCTION: YOU SHOULD
NOT CHANGE THIS FUNCTION`, that means you should not modify the
implementation of that function as it is critical for the grading.

The followings are hints or tips for this assignment.

- **Address translation**: You should be careful about the
  representation of the address. All addresses provided through the
  user prompts are the addresses embedded within the program binary
  (i.e., the address right after linking). Thus, it is not the virtual
  address after being loaded into the memory. This will need you to
  translate the user-provided address into the virtual address (HINT:
  look at the code `get_iamge_baseaddr()` and `construct_procmaps()`).
  
- **Error handling**: If possible, our grading script won't be testing
  corner cases to see if you have well handled all bizzare corner
  cases. So please focus on implementing all the debugging features
  described in this document.

- **General output format**: You do not need to strictly follow the
  output format of the reference implementation (which is shown
  above). As long as you don't modify the functions as instructed in
  `snudbg.c`, your implementation would receive full marks. The
  exception is when you implement the command `read`, which we
  elaborate next.

- **Output format of read command**: When implementing the `read`
  command, you should be using the function `dump_addr_in_hex()` to
  print the data address. This is because the testing (i.e.,
  `test/run_test.py`) relies on the output format of this function.
  
## Manual Testing

To help your **debugging process** of `snuDbg`, we provide two sample
programs, `rand` (see `test/sample-rand/rand.c`) and `array` (see
`test/sample-array/array.c`). Note that we provide the pre-built
binaries for these two programs (check `test/prebuilt/rand` and
`test/prebuilt/array`). This is because 1) addresses of these binaries
may subject to change depending on compiler versions and platforms and
2) the address has to be fixed for easy input/ouput testing.

To help you to get the better sence of how the reference
implementation of `snuDbg` works, we provide input/output pairs. Note
that your `snuDbg` does not need to strictly follow the output format
of the reference implementation. As long as your `snuDbg` passes all
the tests of `test/run_test.py`, you should be fine.


## Automated Testing

In the end, you can test your implementation using the testing script
`test/run_test.py`. This runs the following three tests.

1. `test_rand_mem_write`: This tests the pre-built binary `rand` with
  the input `rand.mem-write.input`. The key of this testing is to
  setup the breakpoint and once the breakpoint is fired, it overwrites
  the global variable holding the random value.

2. `test_rand_set_reg`: This tests the binary `rand` with the input
  `rand.set-reg.input`. The key of this testing is to
  assign the `ZF` flag at the breakpoint such that the run always
  passes the random value check.
  
3. `test_array_check`: This tests the binary `array` with the input
  `array.check.input`. The key of this testing is to check `snuDbg`'s
  feature in dumping the memory.
  
  
Once your implementation is near to complete, you should be able to
get the following result.

```sh
$ ./run_test.py
[+] PASS: test_rand_mem_write
[+] PASS: test_rand_set_reg
[+] PASS: test_array_check
```

Since the grading would be similar to how `run_test.py` checks your
`snuDbg`, you are encouraged to have a look at how the testing is done
to avoid potential missing points.

## Logistics

This is an individual project, so you should work alone. You may
discuss with your classmates, but such a discussion should be well
noted in your submission and you should write your own code.

## Submission

Prepare your submission with following commands:

```
$ ./prepare-submit.sh 
[*] Remove tar file...
[*] Compress files...
src/snudbg.c
[*] Successfully Compressed!
[*] Done! You are ready to submit: assign5.tar.gz
```

Upload `assign5.tar.gz` to the submission server. The URL of the
submission server will be provided later.
